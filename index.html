  <h3>Info</h3>
  <p>Welcome to CreativeMaths the home of online mathematics Practice and Testing.
  <br> CreativeMaths is a digital classroom tool designed for both teachers and students to help the students master their multiplication and division facts, while giving teachers a powerfull timed testing method, and giving both teachers and students in depth student results. 
  </p>
  <p>
  CreativeMaths all began in the fall of 2024 when the Hope Haven School Teacher Mr. Jean Claude wanted a way to continue giving his 70 question timed Multiplication and Division facts test to his 12th grade students but couldnâ€™t find a suitable online method to give out said test. And so with his student who was web developer, Creativekmaths was created to fill this need for an online timed test service and an practice service for students. 
  </p>
  <p>
  CreativeMaths Provideds all of its current features free of charge as a hope to give students acces to 
  </p>
  <p>
  As of know CreativeMaths has 3 different built in Calculation and Logic Question testing bundels. These 2 different tests are just for now and we will be adding more testing methods as the days progress, aswell as hopefully an input your own test feature for Teacher acounts. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Give any of these built in tests a whirl right now by clicking here.
